# ML_Projects

It consists of different Machine Learning projects.

**Thyroid Detection**

- This was basically healthcare related project where the use case was to predict the type of thyroid for the patient.
- Consider, the scenario where  positive thyroid is detected for the patient. Here we can expedite the entire process
To treat the patient by senior docotrs.
- However, it the patient is detected as negative  then the case is case to junior doctors where some additional testing is done for them and result is concluded.

**Wafer Fault Detection**

 -There is a production line which consists of different sensors each having wafers now when there is fault in the production line we have to check each wafer reading of each sensor and decide which wafer needs to be replaced. This was previously done by stopping the entire production line . However, now we need to automate the entire system so when a faulty wafer is predicted we can get alarm so that only that part of production needs to be stopped and the wafer will the replaced.
- The entire project pipeline is divided into different modules such as Data Validation, Data Transformation, Data Pre-processing, Model Training , Prediction, and for each section log file as maintained for example in Training log files are maintained  for each module before the start and the end the each method which helps the debugging easier and makes successful transition to the support team.
